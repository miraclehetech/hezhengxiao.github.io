Modern displays nowadays possess the capability to render video content with a high dynamic range (HDR) and an extensive color gamut (WCG).However, the majority of available resources are still in standard dynamic range(SDR). Therefore, we need to identify an effective methodology for this objective.The existing deep neural network (DNN) based SDR(Standard dynamic range) to HDR (High dynamic range) conversion methods outperform conventional methods, but they are either too large to implement or generate some terrible artifacts. We propose a neural network for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion, termed "FastHDRNet". This network includes two parts, Adaptive Universal Color Transformation and Local Enhancement.The architecture is designed as a lightweight network that utilizes global statistics and local information with super high efficiency. After the experiment, we find that our proposed method achieve state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative comparisons and visual quality with a lightweight structure and a enhanced infer speed.
